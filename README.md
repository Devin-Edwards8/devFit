# DevFit

My app to achieve my personal fitness goals. Using the React Native framework, I developed screens for tracking my daily nutritional intake and storing my workout plans. I also included a motivational quote. 

## Nutrition Screen

I built this screen to track my caloric and protein intake. Using EDAMAM's food and grocery database, a user can search for this nutritional information, or they can enter it manually.

## Workout Screen

This screen provides a simple interface for a user to track their workout plan.
